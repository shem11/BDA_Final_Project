Study Title	"Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure"
Study Description	"Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p=2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04), cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07), receptor binding (p=6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses."

Study Protocol Description	"processed Cy3 signal intensity"	"1.65 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity >10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 250 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ul of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112A) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation."	"Samples were supplied on ice with overnight delivery and were cultured 24 h prior irradiation and 16 h prior harvesting, postirradiation. Growth medium, NMM-100, was kindly supplied by the manufacturer. Medium was changed every 24h."	"The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 9.1.3.1 (Agilent) using default parameters (protocol GE1-v1_91_1 and Grid: 014850_D_20070207) to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended green Processed Signal intensities.  Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers or Features not Positive and significant were excluded"	"Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4x44k array slides (Scan setting with extended dynamic range, Scan area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 5um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to XDR Hi 100% and XDR Lo 10%)."	"Tissues were irradiated with 0 and 2.5Gy of protons"	"Total RNA was isolated with RNaqueous Kit (Applied Biosystems), tested for spectral characteristics (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific) and electrophoretically (Bioanalyser 2100, Agilent)."	"Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 ug RNA using the One-Color Quick-Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer."
